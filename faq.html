	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h2>Who the hell made this?</h2>
	<p class="faq">Hi there! I'm Wander Siemers, a 15-year-old iOS developer from Amsterdam. Read more about me on the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page.</p>

	<h2>How do I view shots other than the popular ones?</h2>
	<p class="faq">Tap the text in the main view that reads "Popular", then tap any of the available lists to view them.</p>

	<h2>Do I need a Dribbble account to use Time Out?</h2>
	<p class="faq">Nope, though you have one, you can tap "Settings" in the upper right corner and enter your username. Go back to the main screen, and you'll see that you can now access the "Following" list. See <i>How do I view other shots than only the popular ones?</i></p>

	<h2>Do I need to have a "Drafted" account on Dribbble to view the "Following" list?</h2>
	<p class="faq">No. Easy answer.</p>

	<h2>My question isn't listed / I have other stuff to tell you</h2>
	<p class="faq">That's fine too. If you found a bug or want support, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@timeoutfordribbble.com">support@timeoutfordribbble.com</a>.
