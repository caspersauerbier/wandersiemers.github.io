	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p class="faq">Hi there! I'm Wander Siemers, a 15-year-old iOS developer from Amsterdam. I started programming in 2012 because I found this whole app making thing pretty cool and wanted to see if it really was as hard as I thought. It was kind of daunting in the beginning, but it was fun regardless so I stuck with it. After a lot of nights spent programming with cheap coffee (I don't have an Aeropress or a fancy grinder. I do have a Philips drip coffee maker. You can stop reading if you're disappointed.) I am finally launching this thing of mine. This is my first project that is actually getting out of my Mac and into your hands, which makes my kind of nervous. (That's not really true, I wrote an app for the open days at my high school.) If you have feedback, you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:wander@timeoutfordribbble.com">wander@timeoutfordribbble.com</a> or contact me via <a href="http:twitter.com/wandersiemers">Twitter</a>. If you're in Amsterdam and would like to meet up, that's cool too. Anyway, I'd love to talk to you!</p>
